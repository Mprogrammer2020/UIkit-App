Setting Up CocoaPods for the Project
Follow these steps to install CocoaPods and create a workspace for this project:

1. Install CocoaPods
If CocoaPods is not already installed on your system, run the following command in Terminal:
sudo gem install cocoapods
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
In Terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project (where the .xcodeproj file is located):
cd /path_to_your_project
3. Install Pods
Install the dependencies specified in the Podfile by running:
pod install
4. Open the Workspace
After the installation completes, always open the project using the .xcworkspace file (not the .xcodeproj file):
5. Build the Project
In Xcode, build the project (Cmd + B) to ensure all dependencies are correctly linked.
